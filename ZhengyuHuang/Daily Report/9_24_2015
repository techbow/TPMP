Cash Hit Rate

Operating System
Page - 8K, read from hardware, smallest unit.
stack size - 8M 

Java file stream (I/O)

Process(进程) -> load into memory and run, they are each independent 
CPU -> time frame (P1, P2, P3 ...)
open a program, then a new process begins, the start of process is very time consuming.

Thread(线程) -> light weight process. interthread communicate. 
main thread, T1 thread, T2 thread
WHY need threads -> -> Read data from website (html + picture) -> decode picture & I/O at the same time. Uncompress picture and read picture.

String Buffer -> multi-thread safe
Hash Table -> multi-thread safe
Hash Map -> not multi-thread safe
String Builder -> not multi-thread safe
vector -> not multi-thread safe
arraylist -> multi-thread safe
Hash Set -> not multi-thread safe

synchronized method is used for only same method (ALL method synchronized) at the same time.

Thread pool -> fixed size, once every thread
