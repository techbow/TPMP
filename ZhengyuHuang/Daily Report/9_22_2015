!!! Class Notes:

REDO "reverse linked list" & "reverse linked list II"4
Reverse linked list (Use first three points p1->p2->p3->)
p1 start == null
move to next loop:
p1 = p2;
p2 = p3;
p3 = p3.next;
At last, when p3 == null, then out of loop, set p2.next = p1.

Binary Search Tree -> Every node in the left subtree always smaller than root val, while every node in the right subtree always bigger than root val. Inorder traversal is sorted.

Use two queues to implement BFS.
