Java UTL -> Vector (Can preassign space)
Iterator<String> iter = mylist.iterator();
while(iter.hasNext()){
	print(iter.next());
}
Class Dept implements Iteratable<People> {

Design how www works (OSI seven layers protocol) 
IP v4 and IP v6. Domain map to IP (DNS server). DNS -> distributed system. Local cache -> Local DNS -> Global DNS. One client and one server use TCP/UDP protocal. UDP works for time and easy to implement. TCP works for accurate.
(TCP -> HTTP, TCP -> Telnet)

Design
Memcache
Consistent Cache (Calculation Redundancy, distribute calculation ability if one node is down)
