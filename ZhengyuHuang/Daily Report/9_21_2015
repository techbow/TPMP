Report to my contract manager for about an hour.

Recommandation - For Algorithm teacher, tell him the password and username of my new Leetcode account. Then it is easy for him to check out Leetcode status.

For advanced part of MyCalc (Java HW1), I have designed a integer calculater containing plus, minus, times and divide with high priority of both times and divide. As a result, the rest of work is to deal with "(" and ")". I can use an ArrayList<Integer> to store all "(" index until I find first ")". For a VALID expression, for loop all index of "(", from right to left, find its right first ")", call foundmental Calc to calculate and insert the String format of result into proper position in string, at the same time, judge its previous char and latter char can only be one of "+", "-", "*" and "/", else println ERROR. Then begin next loop until all "(" index has been processed. (Done)
