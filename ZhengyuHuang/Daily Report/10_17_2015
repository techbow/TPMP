!!! Daily Report


!!! Algorithm morning notes:

Finding job. Several Frameworks (such as AngularJS) Suppose I can do a job. I have worked for Techbow (Startup) and do big data solution for some commercial banks and code is confidential that I can not show you. Your company is a better platform than this startup for me to begin my career. 

Big Data -> 外排序

Find most frequent IPs visited last 24 hours.
HashMap (key, value) -> (IP address, visited times)
Implement an object having IP address and visited times, using vistied times as criteria to sort and find top 10.
Very Vague for Big Data Problem, test communication problem. 
For previous problem, ask:
1) How many clients will visit this website? (Eye see -> Can contain in only one hashtable -> Can not read into 1G memory)
IP v4 (32 bits) and IP v6 (64 bits). Time stamp (64 bits). Altogether 32 bytes one record. 1 billion record -> 32G. How many possible different IP addresses. 

If memory is not enough, use split IP addresses into 10 pieces (mod 10). Or if URL (String), then use Hash function. 

? 250 million integer(1 G), find distinct one. (For small data, sort or use hash table)

Bloom Filter (Can delete?)
Reservoir Sampling 
Random5 -> Random7
(5*Random5 + Random5) % 7 (后面多余的扔掉)

!!! Web Class
!!! -> Wei Han
HTML/CSS/Javascript
First -> HTML
What questions will be asked during interview:
HTML is foundmental, will not be asked during interview, but will show during CSS and JavaScript.

w3cschool -> HTML Quizs.
Element, network and console <- Chrome inspect element.
<pre>, <br> -> not recommended

placeholder
Safari "Required" not function, but Chrome works.
HTML Local Storage
JavaScript Canvas Game (D3 framework -> SVG)
