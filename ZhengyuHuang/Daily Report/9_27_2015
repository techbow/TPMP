!!! Morning algorithm class:

Lecture Nodes:

ListNode Wrapper
O(n) -> Botton up to BST
O(nlgn) -> Find middle List to BST (upside down)
O(n) -> Array to BST
Get List Length (Ask for interviewer whether I need to implement "getListLen")
Word Search -> Time complexity -> O(4^N) suppose length of input String equals to N.

PowerSet(All subsets)
Subsets -> Bits Representative map & DFS & BFS
How to explain DFS (The process of [1,2,3] to the PowerSet)

Interview:

(Amazon)
CS Fundamentals
Problem Solving
Algorithms
Coding
Design
*Leadership Principle

Cover -> branch (test case)
craking coding interview
Design Question (special terms - dimand, heart)

Do not silence -> Do not spend time on detail -> Do not talk too much (Do not show personal preference) -> Do not email the interviewer

Do speak loud -> do break down the problem -> do ask questions

impression is very important. Leave interviewer a good impression.

Hiring manager, bar raiser, SDE II -> 1 hour each
Feedback is normally collected in 2 days.

Hiring Manager: Backbone, Disagree & Commit, Ownership, Earns Trust of Others (Teamwork & Communications) -> Whether fit in his/her team
Design Question -> Scalibility (High level)

Coding -> logical and maintainable, insists on the highest standards
System Design -> Scalability and operatinal performance, Bias for Action
Coding (Bar raiser): Problem solving; Delivers Result & Right A Lot
Amazon first cloud service -> Half year refer wait.

Google level V
